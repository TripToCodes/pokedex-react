## ‚è≥ App Limitations
The app follows as closely as possible the requirements as laid down in the Take Home Exercise requirements. Except for the advanced requirements such as matching the Pokemon type with the style of the card, displaying the Pokemon's base stats with charts, and displaying a few random Pokemons upon loading before searching due to lack of time.

## üí° Future Improvements

This project only lays down some foundations for a more complex app. There are future improvements that should be added:

- Cache all lists and reuse them, as there are no Create, Update, or Delete operations
- Improve UX to allow the user to view all cards after searching. For now, we need to search with empty keywords to see them
- Save collected card at the local storages 
- Add loading and error state
- Display a few featured cards on the initial page and have the "featured" filter
- Fetch only part of the data when scrolling down further
- Study and apply TanStack, a library that allows controlled data fetching, caching, and synchronizing
- Apply Chart.js to visualize Pokemon stats better
- Make the page responsive
- Style the card with colors that match with Pokemon's types
